              <h1>Server Rules</h1>
              <div id="rules">
                <ol>
                  <li>No spamming/flooding. If you need to do commands that may spam chat in the discord, make sure to do it in #➢bot-commands.</li>
                  <li>No inappropriate usernames. No one wants to have an unpleasant experience by reading an inappropriate username, so please keep it nice.</li>
                  <li>Speak English only. This is an English-based server, so please avoid speaking in any other languages.</li>
                  <li>No slurs of any kind. If you are caught saying any slurs, including the r-slur, you'll be instantly banned.</li>
                  <li>No NSFW conversations and media. Have in mind that there are younger children in this server, so please try to keep it all SFW.</li>
                  <li>No religious, political, and controversial topics in chat. Those have started heated arguments in the past, so we'd rather not have to deal with those again.</li>
                  <li>Avoid being rude or toxic to other players. Everyone here just wants to have a good time playing, so there's no need to ruin their moment or have yours ruined.</li>
                  <li>No excessive swearing or cursing. Players are allowed to curse, just not in an excessive amount.</li>
                  <li>No conversations about heavy topics, such as self-harm, suicide, or other things of that nature. There's plenty of people here who have suffered with things like that, so avoid it at all costs. If you're going through something delicate at the moment, please seek professional help.</li>
                  <li>Do not @ the original owner (Sas) for any reasons whatsoever. He's usually busy dealing with his own matters, so if you need any help, contact an available staff member or the newer owner (Sas).</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h3>Gameplay Rules</h3>
                  <ol start="1">
                  <li>No hacking of any kind. That includes the use of autoclickers and x-ray.</li>
                  <li>No using any type of macros. In-game glitches that allow you to do this are also included.</li>
                  <li>No griefing bases and stealing items. That's also applied to unclaimed builds/items.</li>
                  <li>No bypassing the 1-hour auto AFK kick. Especially if it's through machines.</li>
                  <li>No excessively killing other players.</li>
                  <li>No teleporting to players or teleporting them to you with the intention to either kill or annoy them.</li>
                  <li>No duping of any kind. That includes carpets, rails, TNT, and so on.</li>
                  <li>No lava-casting.</li>
                  <li>No wars amongst players/groups. The only time this is allowed is when both parties consent, and when both fully understand staff will not intervene should builds be griefed and items stolen.</li>
                  <li>No claiming other peoples' properties or troll claiming.</li>
                  <li>No placing TNT, spawners, or any gravity-affected block at the End portal. Those will be teleported to spawn and do damage to the ones who are there.</li>
                  <li>No breaking other player's end crystals or killing their dragon without their permission. They've worked hard to get those crystals to summon the dragon once again, so it's not fair for someone else to take their items/kill from them.</li>
                  <li>No owning another player’s head without consent. That usually happens due to spam killing or non-consensual killing.</li>
                  <li>No possessing bedrock, barrier blocks, or any sort of block that is not obtainable through playing. If you find any of those, please report it to management (Admin+).</li>
                  <li>No creating shops outside /warp shops. After all, there's a reason why the warp was created.</li>
                  <li>No flying in the End or during combat in /warp pvp. We've added this rule to make it harder to explore it, and to keep PVP fair.</li>
                  <li>No claiming around spawn. Be aware that if you do so, your claim will most likely be removed.</li>
                  <li>No beacons allowed in /warp shops. They've been causing too much lag.</li>
                  <li>Do not take all of the crops in /warp farm without replanting them. Take what you need and replant it back at all times.</li>
                  <li>No naming your weapons inappropriate names. That includes slurs, controversial opinions/comments, NSFW, and offensive content.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h3>Lag Rules</h3>
                  <ol start="1">
                  <li>Maximum of 40 villagers in a loaded area (7x7 chunks).</li>
                  <li>Maximum of 25 spawners in a loaded area.</li>
                  <li>Autokillers must be included in farms to avoid entity cramming.</li>
                  <li>No automatic villager breeders.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>If your farm is causing lag, staff have the right to remove the spawners from it and return it to you, whether that be directly into your inventory or in a chest near the original area of the farm.</p>
                  <h3>Advertising Rules</h3>
                  <ol start="1">
                  <li>No advertising of any kind in both the Discord or Minecraft server. This does not include, whatsoever, your own shop or town located in the SMP.</li>
                  <li>Do not DM members of Flight to promote your own Discord or Minecraft server.</li>
                  <li>Do not advertise Flight SMP to other servers without the permission of staff members. This ruins our image and will result in an instant ban.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>You will be warned and temporarily muted once you break one of the advertising rules for the first time. If it happens again, you will be permanently banned.</p>
                  <h3>Ban Rules</h3>
                  <ol start="1">
                  <li>Do not use an alt to bypass a ban or a mute. This rule goes for both the Discord and Minecraft servers.</li>
                  <li>If you banned or muted, appeal for it in #⋫tickets. You can also appeal for warns which you believe were given wrongly.</li>
                  <li>Do not bypass a ban or a mute given in the SMP through the Discord server. If that happens, you'll get muted here as well.</li>
                  <li>Do not beg to be unmuted or unbanned. That will only result in an increased time of the punishment.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h3>Ticket Rules</h3>
                  <ol start="1">
                  <li>Once a ticket is created, immediately tell us your problem. Don’t wait to be prompted by staff.</li>
                  <li>Do not beg for a response from staff in tickets. We have our own lives too! Your ticket will be answered as soon as possible.</li>
                  <li>Do not spam ping staff members in tickets.</li>
                  <li>If a ticket becomes inactive after 48 hours of no response (after us pinging you), it will be closed. You can make another one in regards to another situation.</li>
                  <li>Staff have the right to close a ticket if we believe the issue has been resolved.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h3>Disclaimers</h3>
                  <ul>
                  <li>You will be punished accordingly for every rule that you break.</li>
                  <li>These rules are subject to change at any time. You will not escape punishment if you aren't aware of a rule as members are notified when a change is made, and it is expected that you have read these rules and understand them.</li>
                  <li>Just because something isn't in the rules doesn’t mean that it's allowed and that you cannot be punished for it.</li>
                  <li>If a staff member makes a decision on a situation, please respect it. If you have an issue with their attitude or decision, message an Admin+ about it.</li>
